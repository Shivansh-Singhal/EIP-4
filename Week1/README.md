#### 1.Convolution: It is a process in which kernel parse throughout the input image so that it can extract the features.
#### 2.Filters/Kernels: It is a matrix used to extract particular features from the image.Like edge detection, blur etc.
#### 3.Epochs: the processing of the whole data in the neural network for a certain number of times is known as epochs.
#### 4.1x1 Convolution: It helps in reducing the size of the image without effecting the features resulting in z-channel dimension reduction.
#### 5.3x3 Convolution: It uses a 3x3 matrix to convolve on the image and helps reduce the size of the image and still keep the features of the image,reducing the size helps in easier processing of the image.
#### 6.Feature Maps: It is the layer which gives us the result of applying a filter on the previous layer.
#### 7.Activation Function: It takes an input and normalize the output to our needs with the help of the provided activation function.
#### 8.Receptive Field: It is the area a pixel covers during convolution of layers .It is of two types :
####                       a.Global RF-at the last layer the g.r.f should be able to cover the whole image pixels
####                       b.Local RF- it covers only the number of pixels which is defined by the kernel.
